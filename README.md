# Image-To-PDF
The user can load images through an input field and save them as PDF files

NOTES: 
- .save() does not work on mobile devices, use the cordova file plugin for this instead


TODO:
- add support for mobile devices
- add support for multiple images
- create a mobile friendly page (use icons for different modes of pdf creation(img, text, etc.))
